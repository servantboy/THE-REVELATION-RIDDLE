THE REVELATION RIDDLE
Revealing a Hidden Prophetic Architecture in Scripture
📘 About This Book
The Revelation Riddle uncovers a unified prophetic structure woven from Genesis to Revelation, built entirely on KJV-only Scripture and the biblical method of typology (Gal. 4:24; 1 Cor. 10:6,11).
This work reveals how:
the daughters of the Old Testament,
the metals of Daniel’s image,
the seven churches of Revelation, and
the prophetic timelines hidden in Scripture
are all interconnected parts of one divine architecture.
The patterns are ancient.
The connections are deliberate.
And the message reaches its climax in the final church age—Laodicea.
This is not commentary.
This is Scripture interpreting Scripture.
