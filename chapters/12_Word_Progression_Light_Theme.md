WORD PROGRESSION (THE LIGHT THEME)
A chronological unfolding of the New Testament Scripture through the Church Age can be seen in the way the Word relates to the body and metals of Daniel’s image, the seven churches, and the prophetic day/night cycle:
	1	Spoken Word – Christ’s earthly ministry (head of gold; the mouth)
	2	Written Word – the early church (chest and arms of silver; the hands)
	3	Hidden Word – the medieval era (belly and thighs of brass; the covered parts)
	4	Printed & Published Word – Reformation & industrial age (legs of iron; global distribution)
	5	Kept Word – Philadelphia era
	6	Hidden Word – Laodicea / end-time coercion (The Word was never absent; it was preserved, but not openly accessible).
This “Word progression” is the light-track that runs in parallel with:
	•	Daniel’s image (from head to feet),
	•	the seven churches (Ephesus to Laodicea),
	•	the prophetic day/night cycle,
	•	and the daughters and kingdoms influencing each era.
The same Lord who said, “Let there be light” (Gen. 1:3) unfolds that light through His Word across time—sometimes openly, sometimes in secret, sometimes preserved by a remnant, and finally resisted and persecuted.
